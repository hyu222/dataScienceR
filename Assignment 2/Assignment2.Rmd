This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

#Read the Wine data and displays it
```{r}
wineData <- read.csv("wine_dataset.csv", header = TRUE)
head(wineData)
```

#Calculates how many rows and columns are in the data

```{r}
#Calculates the number of data points (number of wines in this case)
nrow(wineData)
#Calculates the number of features (wine properties in this case)
ncol(wineData)
col<-ncol(wineData)


```

#Creates a histogram of fixed acidity 
```{r}
#creates a histogram of fixed acidity
hist(wineData$fixed.acidity)
```

#Creates a scatter plot where pH is a function of fixed acidity 

```{r}
#create a scatter plot where pH is a function of fixed acidity 
plot(wineData$fixed.acidity,wineData$pH)
```
#Loops through the data and finds the SD and mean for all features

```{r}
#loops through the data and provides the mean and the standard deviation of all the columns 
  for(i in 2:col){
    print(colnames(wineData)[i])
    print(mean(wineData[, i]))
    print(sd(wineData[, i]))
  }

  
  
```
#Creates a subset of the data that only contains datapoints where pH is less than 3 SD from the mean

```{r}
#creates a subset of wines that only have a pH less than 3 standard deviations away from the mean
wineDataSub <- subset(wineData, abs(wineData$pH-mean(wineData$pH)) <  sd(wineData$pH)*3)
#calculates how many wines are in the new subset
nrow(wineDataSub)

```

#Writes the new dataset into a CSV file
```{r}
#Writing the new dataset from R to a CSV file 
write.csv(wineDataSub, "WineDataSubset.csv")
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
